# Tic-Tac-Toe
In this project, I've developed a simple yet engaging game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The game is built with Python, providing a familiar grid interface where two players can compete in turns. My Python scripts are finely tuned to handle game logic, player input, and outcome determination, ensuring a seamless and interactive gaming experience.


To enhance the functionality and maintain the game's state, I utilized SQL views and PLpgSQL functions. These database features allow for storing past game results and player statistics, adding a layer of depth to the project by enabling historical performance tracking.

Additionally, I've crafted a series of Python functions that underpin the gameâ€™s mechanics. These tools streamline gameplay, manage player interactions, and facilitate smooth transitions between different stages of the game, making each session both challenging and enjoyable.
